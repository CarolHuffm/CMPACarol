# Stained Glass Making: A Visual Guide

Stained glass making is a meticulous craft that combines artistry and technical skill. This guide provides a visual overview of the process, from design to completion.

## Step 1: Designing the Pattern

The process begins with creating a pattern, known as a "cartoon," which serves as a full-scale guide for the stained glass piece. This design outlines the shapes and sizes of each glass piece.

## Step 2: Selecting and Cutting the Glass

Once the pattern is ready, glass sheets are selected based on color and texture. Using a glass cutter, the glass is scored and then snapped along the lines to match the pattern.

## Step 3: Leading and Soldering

The cut glass pieces are then arranged, and held together using lead came. The joints are soldered to secure the pieces in place.

## Step 4: Cementing and Finishing

The assembled piece is cemented to waterproof and strengthen the joints. After cleaning off excess cement, the glass is polished to enhance its brilliance.
