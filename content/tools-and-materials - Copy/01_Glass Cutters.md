# Glass Cutters

Glass cutters are one of the most fundamental tools in stained glass making. They are designed to score glass so that it breaks cleanly along the line. Unlike knives, cutters do not actually cut through the material—they create a controlled fracture.  

## Types of Cutters
- **Pistol-grip cutters** – ergonomic and great for beginners.
- **Pencil-style cutters** – lightweight and precise.
- **Oil-fed cutters** – release lubrication for smoother cuts.

### How to Use
1. Hold the cutter at a 90° angle.
2. Score in one continuous motion.
3. Use running pliers to snap along the score line.
