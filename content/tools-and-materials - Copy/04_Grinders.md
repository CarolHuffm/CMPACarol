# Grinders

Grinders smooth and shape the sharp edges of cut glass, making pieces fit more precisely and safer to handle.  

## Key Features
- **Diamond-coated bits** – durable and precise.
- **Water reservoir** – keeps glass cool while grinding.
- **Safety shield** – protects from glass dust.

### Usage Tips
1. Always use water in the reservoir.
2. Apply light, even pressure.
3. Rotate pieces to avoid flat spots.

- Essential for tight-fitting designs.
- Reduces risk of cuts.
- Improves soldering alignment.
