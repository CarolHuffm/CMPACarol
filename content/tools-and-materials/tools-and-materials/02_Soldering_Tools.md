# Soldering Tools

Soldering joins your stained glass pieces together using a tin-lead or lead-free alloy. This step is critical for both structure and design.

## Essential Tools
- **Soldering Iron** – usually 80–100 watts for steady heat.
- **Iron Stand** – keeps your work area safe.
- **Flux Brush** – applies flux evenly to foil or lead came.

### Best Practices
- Keep the iron tip clean with a damp sponge.
- Apply flux sparingly; too much causes bubbling.
- Work in a well-ventilated area.

> Flux is your friend—without it, solder won’t flow.
