# Step-by-Step Stained Glass Making

Stained glass making is a detailed craft that requires patience, precision, and creativity. Each step builds upon the previous one, combining artistic design with technical skill. This section provides a clear overview of the process and includes both visual and text-based resources to support learning.

## Step 1: Designing the Pattern  
The process begins with creating a pattern or "cartoon," which is a full-scale drawing of the stained glass window. Each section of glass is carefully planned to fit together like a puzzle, with consideration given to colors, textures, and light.

## Step 2: Selecting and Cutting the Glass  
Artists choose sheets of glass that match the colors and textures needed for the design. Using special cutting tools, each piece is cut to fit the pattern. Accuracy in this stage is crucial, as even small mistakes can affect the alignment of the final window.

## Step 3: Leading and Assembly  
Strips of lead, called cames, are used to hold the glass pieces together. The pieces are fitted into the lead strips, and joints are soldered to secure the panel. This process creates the framework that gives the stained glass its strength and structure.

## Step 4: Cementing and Finishing  
Once assembled, the panel is cemented to make it waterproof and structurally sound. Excess cement is cleaned off, and the glass is polished to reveal its brilliance. At this stage, the stained glass is ready for installation in windows, doors, or decorative displays.
